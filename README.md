# M.A.P.S
Team -81 

M.A.P.S is all about a highly precise automated soldering system, which allows the user to solder micro-circuits as precisely as possible. The idea is to have an automated robotic arm that works on hand gestures as input providing flexibility of different levels of precisions. The user wears a glove and sends input signals using hand gestures. When a movement instruction is successfully received by the machine, haptic feedback is received from the gloves. The motivation behind the idea is the use of large robotic machines at a manufacturing level in the industrial world. This machine can be easily used on an individual level and the idea can be extended for some other precision-related activities.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

The problem is one faced by the maker community, which is precisely soldering small pcb components without any bridging. While working on a solder job that requires precision and stability, we might find ourselves struggling with the job. The iron might create unwanted bridges in the circuit, it might even remove pre-soldered components from the board or even damage the components due to prolonged heating. There is also the issue of safety around a 350 degrees celsius soldering iron. Our project aims to deal with all of these issues with a simple and elegant solution.

**PROOF OF SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PROBLEM**

Due to erroneous soldering the circuit could get destroyed which may cost a lot. Usually in soldering micro-components manually the precision of the maker is not much effective which may lead to poor soldering. Due to poor soldering, short-circuiting may take place which eventually destroy the purpose of the circuit. Also various makers have suggested that errors occur in soldering due to the non-availability of good quality soldering iron. Most of the makers face problem while soldering their circuit components. Some of these problems include personal injury. Sometimes makers may burn their hands or fingers as the temperature of the iron rod used in soldering is about 350 degree celsius.

**PROOF OF NOVELTY OF THE PROBLEM OR PROPOSED SOLUTION**

This invention is related to electrically heated tools and more particularly towards electrically heated soldering iron rods designed for more or less constant use and for fine work, such as connections like SMD soldering etc. With the help of this invention we can do fine soldering on small circuits very easily by scaling our hand movement to very precise value. This precision soldering machine which is controlled by human hand movements is also useful for those designers/makers whose hands are not stable during doing fine work and are not able to work on small circuits.This machine is much safer and easy to use .The user has to move his hands in his ordinary ways but the machine arms will move in the corresponding way and will solder the required component for the user. Several makers face difficulties in fine soldering as they can not get the required precision by hand soldering. Soldering components in small circuits is a more sophisticated work. We have to keep in mind a lot of things while doing such work physically. Our machine allows the user to carry out such sophisticated work very precisely and more efficiently. It also brings dexterity to our work. The machine copies our hand movements and smoothes out any errors due to shaking of hands. The precision soldering machine is designed in such a way that if we move our hand in any direction then soldering point will move after scaling down our hand movement.

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

The idea is to have two robotic arms, one to hold the soldering iron and one to dispense the solder wire. Each robotic arm will be maneuvered using three servo motors. One DC geared motor will also be used for dispensing solder wire from a spool. The arms will move based on input from two motion processing units(gyroscope + accelerometer), one on each hand. The goal here is to smoothen and scale down the movements of the hands and project those movements onto the robotic arms.
